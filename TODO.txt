Maybe implement some of the following:

1. **Enhanced Styling**: Update the visuals with CSS, 
     maybe add animations for disk movement, also need to 
     add styling and responsiveness for mobile / 
     small screen sizes, using devtools device toggle 
     the game doesn't really work on iphone or 
     touchscreens

3. **Timer and Move Counter**: Implement a timer to track how long it
     takes for the player to solve the puzzle and a move counter to
     count the number of moves made. 

4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure the game is playable and looks good on mobile devices. 
     This might involve touch controls rather than drag-and-drop.

5. **Sound Effects**: Add sound effects for successful moves, invalid moves, and game completion.

6. **Save Game State**: Use `localStorage` or indexedDB to save the game's state 
     so that users can pick up where they left off if they close the browser.
