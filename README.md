# Towers of Hanoi

  

**The Towers of Hanoi is a classic puzzle game. The objective is to move an entire stack of disks from one rod to another, obeying the following rules:**

  

- Only one disk can be moved at a time.

- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.

- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

**This repository contains a simple implementation of the game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.**
