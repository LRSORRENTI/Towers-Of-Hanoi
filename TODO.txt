Maybe implement some of the following:

1. **Enhanced Styling**: Update the visuals with CSS, 
     maybe add animations for disk movement

2. **Use TypeScript**: TypeScript can help catch type-related errors
     at compile-time

3. **Timer and Move Counter**: Implement a timer to track how long it
     takes for the player to solve the puzzle and a move counter to
     count the number of moves made. 

4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure the game is playable and looks good on mobile devices. 
     This might involve touch controls rather than drag-and-drop.

5. **Sound Effects**: Add sound effects for successful moves, invalid moves, and game completion.

6. **Save Game State**: Use `localStorage` or indexedDB to save the game's state 
     so that users can pick up where they left off if they close the browser.

7. Need to add some paragraph or tooltip maybe 
  that activates on click of the how to play button, 
  maybe display none of a paragraph beneath, 
  then onclick change it to display block
